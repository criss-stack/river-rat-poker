# 🐀 River Rat Poker

A whimsical browser-based Texas hold'em poker game featuring a cigar-puffing Rat Dealer. This early prototype lets you choose how many seats are available at the table and shows a simple animated dealer.

## Development

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser to see the table. You will be prompted for the number of seats (between 2 and 8), and placeholders for each seat will appear around the table.

## Scripts

```bash
npm test
npm install
```

Currently, there are no automated tests. The command above simply reports that tests have not been written yet.
